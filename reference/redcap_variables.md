# Enumerate the exported variables

This function calls the 'exportFieldNames' function of the REDCap API.

## Usage

``` r
redcap_variables(
  redcap_uri,
  token,
  verbose = TRUE,
  config_options = NULL,
  handle_httr = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- redcap_uri:

  The
  [uri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)/url
  of the REDCap server typically formatted as
  "https://server.org/apps/redcap/api/". Required.

- token:

  The user-specific string that serves as the password for a project.
  Required.

- verbose:

  A boolean value indicating if `message`s should be printed to the R
  console during the operation. The verbose output might contain
  sensitive information (*e.g.* PHI), so turn this off if the output
  might be visible somewhere public. Optional.

- config_options:

  A list of options passed to
  [`httr::POST()`](https://httr.r-lib.org/reference/POST.html). See
  details at
  [`httr::httr_options()`](https://httr.r-lib.org/reference/httr_options.html).
  Optional.

- handle_httr:

  The value passed to the `handle` parameter of
  [`httr::POST()`](https://httr.r-lib.org/reference/POST.html). This is
  useful for only unconventional authentication approaches. It should be
  `NULL` for most institutions. Optional.

## Value

Currently, a list is returned with the following elements,

- `data`: A
  [`tibble::tibble()`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble.html)
  where each row represents one column in the REDCap dataset.

- `success`: A boolean value indicating if the operation was apparently
  successful.

- `status_code`: The [http status
  code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) of the
  operation.

- `outcome_message`: A human readable string indicating the operation's
  outcome.

- `elapsed_seconds`: The duration of the function.

- `raw_text`: If an operation is NOT successful, the text returned by
  REDCap. If an operation is successful, the `raw_text` is returned as
  an empty string to save RAM.

## Details

As of REDCap version 6.14.2, three variable types are *not* returned in
this call: calculated, file, and descriptive. All variables returned are
writable/uploadable.
