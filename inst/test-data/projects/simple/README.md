Steps to establish this project on a new server

1. Click the "New Project" button on the home screen
   (ie, it has green letters and a "+")
1. Name it "REDCapR: simple"
1. Designate the purpose as "Operational Support"
1. Upload [project.xml](project.xml)
1. In the "Health" instrument, save each of the five records,
   so `bmi` is populated
   (ie, it's a calculated field)
1. In records 4 & 5, in the `comments`, add an extra line break after the first line if necessary.
   Sometimes consecutive line breaks are combined when the xml is imported.
