arm-single-delete Setup
==============

In addition to the typical steps to establish a project,
make sure the plugin on your test server is updated to the correct `project_id` value in the delete sql.

The sql is in [wipe-project-redcapr-arm-delete-single.php](../../../../utility/plugins/wipe-project-redcapr-arm-delete-single.php).
