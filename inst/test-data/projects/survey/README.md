Additional (manual) steps to establish the test project on a new server.
I don't know how to preserve these states/values in the xml file.

1.  For records 1 & 2:
    1. The `prescreening_survey_timestamp` field needs to be set and
    1. For both records, click the "Open Survey" button
    (in the "Survey Options" dropdown)
    and submit.
    1. Save the record (eg, blue "Save & Stay" button)

1.  For record 1 only:
    1. Delete the entry for the "Participant Morale Questionnaire"
    1. Start a new entry for the "Participant Morale Questionnaire"
    1. Set it to "Incomplete"
    1. In the survey options dropdown box, select "Open survey"
    1. Click "Save & Return Later"
    1. Save the record (eg, blue "Save & Stay" button)
    1. In the Record Status Dashboard, verify the "Participant Morale Questionnaire" status is orange
