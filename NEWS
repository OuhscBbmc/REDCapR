Versions 0.9 & 0.8 (Developed 2015-01-15 through 2015-08-14)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:
* Adapted for version 1.0.0 of httr (which is now based on the `curl` package, instead of `RCurl`).

Minor Updates:
* Uses `requireNamespace()` instead of `require()`.
* By default, uses the SSL cert files used by httr, which by default, uses those packaged with R.
* Added warning if it appears `readcap_read()` is being used without 'Full Data Set' export privileges.  The problem involves the record IDs are hashed.
* Reconnected code that reads only the `id_position` in the first stage of batching.  The metadata needed to be read before that, after the updates for REDCap Version 6.0.x.
* `retrieve_token_mssql()` uses regexes to validate parameters

Version 0.7 (Developed 2014-12-17 through 2014-12-17)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features: 
* Updated for Version 6.0.x of REDCap (which introduced a lot of improvements to API behavior).

Version 0.6 (Developed 2014-10-29 through 2014-11-03)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features: 
* The `config_options` in the `httr` package are exposed to the REDCapR user.  See issues #55 & #58; thanks to @rparrish and @nutterb for their contributions (https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/issues/55 & https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/issues/58).

Version 0.5 (Developed 2014-09-20 through 2014-10-19)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features: 
* `redcap_metadata_read` are tested and public.

Minor Updates:
* Test suite now uses `testthat::skip_on_cran()` before any call involving OUHSC's REDCap server.
* Vignette example of subsetting, conditioned on a 2nd variable's value.

Version 0.4 (Developed 2014-09-01 through 2014-09-20)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:
* `redcap_write` and `redcap_write_oneshot` are now tested and public.
* `redcap_write` and `redcap_write_oneshot` are now tested and public.
* `redcap_download_file_oneshot` function contributed by John Aponte (@johnaponte; Pull request #35)
* `redcap_upload_file_oneshot` function contributed by @johnaponte (Pull request #34)
* Users can specify if an operation should continue after an error occurs on a batch read or write.  Regardless of their choice, more debugging output is written to the console if `verbose==TRUE`.  Follows advice of @johnaponte, Benjamin Nutter (@nutterb), and Rollie Parrish (@rparrish). Closes #43.

Breaking Changes:
* The `records_collapsed` default empty value is now an empty string (ie, "") instead of NULL.  This applies when `records_collapsed` is either a parameter, or a returned value.

Updates:
* By default, the SSL certs come from the `httr` package.  However, REDCapR will continue to maintain a copy in case httr's version on CRAN gets out of date.
* The tests are split into two collections: one that's run by the CRAN checks, and the other run manually.  [Thanks, Gabor Csardi](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25595487/testthat-pattern-for-long-running-tests).  Any test with a dependency outside the package code (especially the REDCap test projects) is run manually so changes to the test databases won't affect the success of building the previous version on CRAN.
* Corrected typo in `redcap_download_file_oneshot()` documentation, but Andrew Peters (@ARPeters; Pull request #45).

Version 0.3 (Developed 2014-07-03 through 2014-09-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:
* Relies on the `httr` package, which provides benefits like the status code message can be captured (eg, 200-OK, 403-Forbidden, 404-NotFound).  See http://cran.r-project.org/package=httr.

Updates:
* Renamed the former `status_message` to `outcome_message`. This is because the message associated with http code returned is conventionally called the 'status messages' (eg, OK, Forbidden, Not Found).
* If an operation is successful, the `raw_text` value` (which was formerly called `raw_csv`) is returned as an empty string to save RAM.  It's not really necessary with httr's status message exposed.

Bug Fixes:
 * Correct batch reads with longitudinal schema #27

Version 0.2 (Developed 2014-01-14 through 2014-07-02)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:
* Added `redcap_column_sanitize()` function to address non-ASCII characters
* Added `redcap_write` (as an internal function).
* The `redcap_project` object reduces repeatedly passing parameters like the server URL, the user token, and the SSL cert location.

Updates:
* New Mozilla SSL Certification Bundles released on cURL (released 2013-12-05; http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem)
* Renamed `redcap_read_batch`  to `redcap_read`. These changes reflect our suggestion that reads should typically be batched.
* Renamed `redcap_read` to `redcap_read_oneshot`
* Renamed `redcap_write` to `redcap_write_oneshot` (which is an internal function).
* Small renames to parameters

Version 0.1 (Developed 2013-11-26 through 2014-01-14)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:
* Introduces redcap_read and redcap_read_batch with documentation
* SSL verify peer by default, using cert file included in package
* Initial submission to GitHub

Enhancements:
* redcap_read takes parameter for raw_or_label (Thanks Rollie Parrish #3)
* redcap_read takes parameter for export_data_access_groups (Thanks Rollie Parrish #4)
